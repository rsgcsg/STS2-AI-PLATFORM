# Architecture

## Product Definition

Host Runtime advances the real Slay the Spire 2 runtime without a normal
display. The shipped route uses the official executable, SceneTree, tasks,
commands, RNG, saves, Mod loader, and native callbacks. Loading selected game
classes or approximating rules is not semantic equivalence.

The stable term `headless` names the no-display CLI/runtime mode. It does not
name a separate current source repository.

## Normal Route

```text
Host Runtime
  discover and fingerprint the installed game
  require an exact supported build for normal start
  launch the official executable with --headless
  manage profile, readiness, resources, logs, stop, and failure

Platform Connector
  expose fair-player Snapshot, Read, and complete finite BoundActions
  keep exact native operands local
  revalidate and deliver native input
  return delivery Receipt and successor Snapshot

Consumer
  choose an advertised action and interpret the successor
  never create game legality or mutate native objects directly
```

REST, stdio, and other transports are delivery mechanisms, not gameplay
authority. The Player Environment contract and SDK are Connector-owned and are
not copied into Host Runtime.

## Route Classification

The shipped Godot process is the Reference Host and has the highest confidence
for semantic ownership. A Managed Host may use the exact game assembly with
narrow presentation adapters, but it remains a separately identified
candidate. It cannot inherit Reference or predecessor runtime authority.

```text
exact game runtime + bounded presentation adapters
-> raw Host-local decision state
-> canonical Player Environment projection and request ledger
```

Raw commands, privileged scenario controls, and native object references never
become a consumer API. Projection, allocation, transport, and supervisor
changes remain Managed Exact while the byte-identical game assembly owns rules,
RNG, effects, and Commit. Persistent reconstruction or short-circuiting of
task/UI lifecycle is Hybrid. Implementing gameplay rules outside the game is a
Simulator.

## Authority And Lifecycle

- STS2 owns rules, RNG, saves, native legality, effects, tasks, commands, and
  Commit.
- Host Runtime owns executable discovery, exact-build admission, profile
  lifecycle, no-display boot, health, resources, reset, recovery, worker
  supervision, and Host evidence.
- Connector owns fair-player Snapshot/Read/action binding, one controller,
  delivery Receipt, and successor.
- Consumers own strategy, projection, rewards, search, and learning.

Every mutation uses one current opaque BoundAction. Connector checks the
snapshot, controller lease, target identity, current actionability, and native
legality at execution. Duplicate request IDs return the same Receipt. An
`unknown` delivery is never retried. Receipt proves input delivery, not an
inferred business transaction.

Process lifecycle is a separate Host plane. Starting, stopping, profile
selection, reset, seed, branch, acceleration, and scenario controls are not
player actions and never enter the fair-player action set. Host controls may
use an exact, process-local diagnostic transport, but it creates no gameplay
authority and is not in the public SDK.

Seed is Host lifecycle state, not a player action. If a development Host accepts
seed or scenario controls, it must bind them to exact runtime provenance and
keep them outside the fair-player contract.

## Profile Boundary

Profile isolation is a Host concern. A Mod cannot guarantee pre-save isolation
when it loads after platform and save initialization. An isolated workflow must
redirect user-data roots before process creation, use an exact observed profile
schema, and verify a distinct runtime/profile generation.

Every runtime command requires exactly one explicit profile mode. Profile
templates bind their payload to exact game identity. Profile and normal
user-data sentinels are evidence of containment, not proof of gameplay
semantics or Steam Cloud server state.

## Release Boundary

A Host Runtime release must pin the Connector package/artifact and exact game
tuple from release metadata. The current source/package candidate is not a
runtime seal when the Host installer pin and root BOM/Connector manifest are
inconsistent. Do not repair that gap by silently accepting a branch, local DLL,
or predecessor release.

A package, boot, loaded identity, mutation, journey, differential, performance,
or qualification result is valid only for the exact source, artifact, game,
Modset, profile, and launch configuration named by its evidence.

## Component Boundary

The root Platform owns these components:

- Connector: Player Environment contract, native bindings, SDK, transports,
  and Connector artifact identity.
- Host Runtime: lifecycle, exact compatibility, isolation/reset, supervision,
  benchmarks, traces, differential orchestration, and Host evidence.
- Annotator: native-human witness recording and session bundles.
- SpireAgent: external consumer/policy in its own repository.
- STPD: external research consumer, data, training, and evaluation.

Historical predecessor names and reports remain in migration/history evidence,
not in the current operational path.
